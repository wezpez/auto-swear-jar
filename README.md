# auto-swear-jar
A language detection model to detect profanity. This project aims to create an automatic swear jar that can detect when a user swears and then automatically donates to a chosen charity.

## Datasets:
For Noise and Unkown labels the Edge Impulse pre-built keyword spotting dataset
was used. https://docs.edgeimpulse.com/docs/pre-built-datasets/keyword-spotting

For the labels, Fuck, Shit, and Ass, The Abuse Project Audio Dataset (TAPAD)
found on Github https://github.com/profanitas/TAPAD was used in conjunction to 
personally aquired data gathered.
